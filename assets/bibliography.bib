However, these portals are usually closed systems and user-generated annotations are almost always kept locked up and remain inaccessible to the Web of Data. We believe that an important step to take is the integration of multimedia annotations and the Linked Data principles. We present the current state of the Open Annotation Model, explain our design rationale, and describe how the model can represent user annotations on multimedia Web resources. Applying this model in Web portals and devices, which support user annotations, should allow clients to easily publish and consume, thus exchange annotations on multimedia Web resources via common Web standards.},

	Abstract = {Cultural institutions are increasingly contributing content to social media platforms to raise awareness and promote use of their collections. Furthermore, they are often the recipients of user comments containing information that may be incorporated in their catalog records. However, not all user-generated comments can be used for the purpose of enriching metadata records. Judging the usefulness of a large number of user comments is a labor-intensive task. Accordingly, our aim was to provide automated support for curation of potentially useful social media comments on digital objects. In this paper, the notion of usefulness is examined in the context of social media comments and compared from the perspective of both end-users and expert users. A machine-learning approach is then introduced to automatically classify comments according to their usefulness. This approach uses syntactic and semantic comment features while taking user context into consideration. We present the results of an experiment we conducted on user comments collected from Flickr Commons collections and YouTube. A study is then carried out on the correlation between the commenting culture of a platform (YouTube and Flickr) with usefulness prediction. Our findings indicate that a few relatively straightforward features can be used for inferring useful comments. However, the influence of features on usefulness classification may vary according to the commenting cultures of platforms.},

	Abstract = {Achieving high precision in search engines is particularly difficult when dealing with specific technical domains, such as the medical domain, where vocabulary mismatch problems are more prone to occur. Query expansion using lexical orsemantic relations is a well-known technique that can attenuate the vocabulary mismatch problem as demonstrated by earlier research. However, existing approaches do not exploit potentially connected open Web-based vocabularies that are increasingly being expressed using the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). In this paper, we propose a query expansion technique that exploits term labels and semantic relationships in such vocabularies to improve search results. We evaluated this technique using a SKOS representation of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the TREC-9 Filtering datasets. Our results show that our SKOS-based query expansion technique improves the P\@10, nDCG\@10 and MAP metrics across various retrieval models.},

ResourceSync is a resource synchronization framework that integrates with the Web architecture and leverages XML sitemaps. We define a model for the ResourceSync framework as a basis for understanding its properties. We then describe experiments in which simulations of a variety of synchronization scenarios illustrate the effects of model configuration on consistency, latency, and data transfer efficiency. These results provide insight into which congurations are appropriate for various application scenarios.

As a possible solution, we propose semantic tagging as a collaborative process in which a user selects and associates Web resources drawn from a knowledge context. We applied this general technique in the specific context of online his- torical maps and allowed users to annotate and tag them. To study the effects of semantic tagging on tag production, the types and categories of obtained tags, and user task load, we conducted an in-lab within-subject experiment with 24 par- ticipants who annotated and tagged two distinct maps. We found that the semantic tagging implementation does not af- fect these parameters, while providing tagging relationships to well-defined concept definitions. Compared to label-based tagging, our technique also gathers positive and negative tag- ging relationships. We believe that our findings carry impli- cations for designers who want to adopt semantic tagging in other contexts and systems on the Web.},

	Abstract = {Europeana is the European Union's flagship digital cultural heritage initiative. the europeana portal, launched in November 2008, showcases the possibility of cross-cultural domain interoperability on a pan-european level. To date, metadata and thumbnails for over 23 million objects have been aggregated from over 1500 providers from the library, archive, museum, and audiovisual domains. It was hoped that cultural heritage communities were ready to think outside the traditional information silos and adopt a linked data paradigm that would enable the development of shared semantic context. As a technical starting point, Europeana carried out a linked open data pilot project. This paper gives an outline of the processes of the pilot project and areas for future work.},

	Abstract = {Interoperability is a qualitative property of computing infrastructures that denotes the ability of sending and receiving systems to exchange and properly interpret information objects across system boundaries. Since this property is not given by default, the interoperability problem and the representation of semantics have been an active research topic for approximately four decades. Early database models such as the Relational Model used schemas to express semantics and implicitly aimed at achieving interoperability by providing programming independence of data storage and access. Thereafter the Entity Relationship Model was introduced providing the basic building blocks of modeling real-world semantics. With the advent of distributed and object-oriented databases, interoperability became an obvious need and an explicit research topic. After a number of intermediate steps such as hypertext and (multimedia) document models, the notions of semantics and interoperability became what they have been over the last ten years in the context of the World Wide Web. With this article we contribute a retrospective on semantics and interoperability research as applied in major areas of computer science. It gives domain experts and newcomers an overview of existing interoperability techniques and points out future research directions.},

	Abstract = {Expressing data in RDF is one of the principles to be considered when making data available as Linked Data on the Web. This can be achieved using RDF-wrappers for existing (relational) data stores or by using RDF stores as data repositories. The latter requires special RDF storage solutions, many of which are available today. Organizations often have difficulties to decide which solution they should adopt because comprehensive comparisons of existing RDF stores are hardly available and experiences w.r.t performance and scalability are still missing. In this report, we summarize the results of qualitative and quantitative study we carried out on existing RDF stores in the context of the European Digital Library project. We give a detailed overview on existing RDF store solutions, analyze their functional and non-functional features, summarize the outcomes of other, previously carried out studies, and conduct a Linked-Data oriented performance evaluation on a subset of existing triple stores w.r.t to load and query time. The results of this study show that certain RDF stores, such as OpenLink Virtuoso or 4Store, can deal with the Europeana data volume and answer those SPARQL queries that are relevant for exposing Europeana metadata as Linked Data in an acceptable time-range.},

In the last three years significant amounts of data have been generated, increasingly forming a globally connected, distributed data space. For multimedia content, metadata are a key factor for efficient management, organization, and retrieval. However, the relationship between multimedia and Linked Data has been rarely studied, leading to a lack of mutual awareness and, as a consequence thereof, technological deficiencies. This article introduces the basic concepts of Linked Data in the context of multimedia metadata, and discusses techniques to generate, expose, discover, and consume Linked Data. It shows that a large amount of data sources exist, which are ready to be exploited by multimedia applications. The benefit of Linked Data in two multimedia-related applications is discussed and open research issues are outlined with the goal of bringing the research fields of multimedia and Linked Data closer together in order to facilitate mutual benefit.

At the same time, named entity recognition and semantic link discovery are applied to each annotation\&rsquo;s text content to further facilitate its interlinking within the Web of Data. To ensure quality and correctness, the system relies on human feedback. This feedback is introduced through a novel interaction metaphor: contextual link suggestions are continuously generated in the background, and superimposed on the annotated map region in the form of a tag cloud. The user can create semantic links by simply clicking on the corresponding tags. The system thus acts both as a visualisation aid for contextually relevant linked data and as a tool for authoring new linked spatiotemporal data entities.},

The major problem developers are confronted with when applying this model in real-world applications is that the CRM constitutes a formal ontology model on a semantic level but lacks technical specifications and guidelines on how to integrate that model with other, data source-specific models. This leads to divergent mappings between proprietary metadata models and the CRM ontology model. The aim of this paper is to provide Model Implementation Guidelines, including a CIDOC CRM mapping methodology, which are based on our practical experience and can serve as a recommendation for future CIDOC CRM adopters. Besides explicitly pointing out the problems the current stan- dard entails, we propose a methodology for reducing the divergence of CRM mappings, which should bring CRM-based systems one step further towards metadata interoperability.},

	Abstract = {The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) has found widespread adoption for exchanging bibliographic metadata. In parallel, the W3C\&rsquo;s Linking Open Data Initiative exposes and interlinks structured data from a variety of data sources on the web. Since many of these data sources contain valuable information for institutional repositories (e.g., shared concept definitions, thesauri, etc.), we believe that institutions that currently expose their data via OAI-PMH can benefit if they integrate their metadata with the data available in the Linked Data cloud. To achieve such an integration, we must bridge the OAI-PMH-specific protocol characteristics that currently prevent OAI-PMH metadata from being interoperable with the Linked Data approach of exposing data. As first contribution of this paper, we describe a possible solution for exposing OAI-PMH metadata on the web as part of the Linked Data cloud. As a second contribution, we present a rule-based mechanism for linking these metadata with other relevant data sources together with a case study that describes possible linking scenarios for three representative OAI-PMH data providers. Finally, we discuss certain quality criteria that OAI-PMH metadata must meet to benefit from data exposed by other Linked Data sources.},

	Abstract = {With the increasing storage capacity of personal computing devices, the problems of information overload and information fragmentation are apparent on users? desktops. For the Web, semantic technologies solve this problem by adding a machine-interpretable information layer on top of existing resources. It has been shown that the application of these technologies to desktop environments is helpful for end users. However, certain characteristics of the Semantic Web architecture that are commonly accepted in the Web context are not desirable for desktops. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose the sile model, which combines characteristics of the Semantic Web and file systems. This model is a conceptual foundation for the Semantic Desktop and serves as underlying infrastructure on which applications and further services can be built. The authors present one service, a virtual file system based on siles, which allows users to semantically annotate files and directories and keeps full compatibility to traditional hierarchical file systems. The authors also discuss how Semantic Web vocabularies can be applied for meaningful annotation of files and present a prototypical implementation of the model and analyze the performance of typical access operations, both on the file system and metadata level.},

@article{Haslhofer:2009sw,
	Abstract = {Cultural institutions and museums have realized that annotations contribute valuable metadata for search and retrieval, which in turn can increase the visibility of the digital items they expose via their digital library systems. By exploiting annotations created by others, visitors can discover content they would not have found otherwise, which implies that annotations must be accessible and processable for humans and machines. Currently, however, there exists no widely adopted annotation standard that goes beyond specific media types. Most institutions build their own in-house annotation solution and employ proprietary annotation models, which are not interoperable with those of other systems. As a result, annotation data are usually stored in closed data silos and visible and processable only within the scope of a certain annotation system. As the main contribution of this paper, we present the LEMO Annotation Framework. It (1) provides a uniform annotation model for multimedia contents and various types of annotations, (2) can address fragments of various content-types in a uniform, interoperable manner and (3) pulls annotations out of closed data silos and makes them available as interoperable, dereferencable Web resources. With the LEMO Annotation Framework annotations become part of the Web and can be processed, linked, and referenced by other services. This in turn leads to even higher visibility and increases the potential value of annotations.},

However, this protocol has two significant drawbacks: it does not make its resources accessible via dereferencable URIs, and it provides only restricted means of selective access to metadata. The OAI2LOD Server handles these shortcomings by republishing metadata originating from an OAI-PMH endpoint according to the principles of Linked Data. As the ongoing OAI-ORE specification process shows, these principles are gaining growing importance also in the digital libraries domain.},

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the technical effort of joining the BRICKS network is minimal compared with the potential benefits of joining the BRICKS community. This paper focuses on the BRICKS importer component, which is based on the Open Archives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). After a short overview of the architecture of the importer and an outline of OAI-PMH, we list the technical requirements of the importer give a detailed list of the steps an institution take to join BRICKS.

However, when organizations want to realize projects that integrate content from various institutions, they face the problem of how to make this content accessible in a coherent way. Since metadata plays a key role in such scenarios, a Metadata Management system that can handle heterogeneous metadata descriptions and be easily integrated into new or existing digital library architectures would be useful. We propose a Metadata Management system that uses Semantic Web technology to handle the problem of heterogeneity and on Web Service technology to achieve easy system integration.
