    The goal of the VIRTCRIME project lies in the development of novel algorithms and methods for tracing criminal transactions in post-Bitcoin era cryptocurrencies, while considering illegitimate activities in Darknet market places. Orthogonally, the project will provide novel criminological procedures and law enforcement approaches, and investigate legal pre-conditions and consequences.

    Research, develop, prototype, test, and deploy mechanisms for the
    large-scale synchronization of web resources. Building on the OAI-PMH
    strategies for synchronizing metadata, this project will enhance that
    specification using modern web technologies, but will allow for the
    synchronization of the objects themselves, not just their metadata.

    Examine application of the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/">Open Annotation
    Specification</a> in the context of digitized historical maps. Design and
    build a collaborative Web environment in which scholars and citizens can
    contribute their knowledge to digitized high-resolution online maps.
    We experimented with designs that integrate the annotation process with
    the re-use of data from public data sources, such as Wikipedia.
