    Research, develop, prototype, test, and deploy mechanisms for the
    large-scale synchronization of web resources. Building on the OAI-PMH
    strategies for synchronizing metadata, this project will enhance that
    specification using modern web technologies, but will allow for the
    synchronization of the objects themselves, not just their metadata.
