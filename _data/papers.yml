  abstract: Bitcoin ist eine dezentrale virtuelle Währung, die dafür genutzt werden
    kann, weltweit pseudoanonymisierte Zahlungen innerhalt kurzer Zeit und mit vergleichsweise
    geringen Transaktionskosten auszuführen. In dieser Abhandlung zeigen wir die ersten
    Ergebnisse eine Langzeitstudie zur Bitcoinadressenkurve, die alle Adressen und
    Transaktionen seit dem Start von Bitcoin im Januar 2009 bis zum 31. August 2016
    enthält. Unsere Untersuchung enthüllt eine stark verschobene Gradverteilung mit
    einer geringen Anzahl von Ausnahmen und zeigt, dass sich die gesamte Kurve stark
    ausdehnt. Außerdem zeigt sie die Macht der Adressbündelungsheuristik zur Identifikation
    von realen Akteuren, die es bevorzugen, Bitcoin für den Wertetransfer statt für
    die Wertespeicherung zu verwenden. Wir gehen davon aus, dass diese Abhandlung
    neue Einblicke in virtuelle Währungsökosysteme bietet und als Grundlage für das
    Design zukünftiger Untersuchungsmethoden und -infrastrukturen dienen kann.

  abstract: Many Web portals allow users to associate additional information with
    existing multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video. However, these
    portals are usually closed systems and user-generated annotations are almost always
    kept locked up and remain inaccessible to the Web of Data. We believe that an
    important step to take is the integration of multimedia annotations and the Linked
    Data principles. We present the current state of the Open Annotation Model, explain
    our design rationale, and describe how the model can represent user annotations
    on multimedia Web resources. Applying this model in Web portals and devices, which
    support user annotations, should allow clients to easily publish and consume,
    thus exchange annotations on multimedia Web resources via common Web standards.

  title: Sifting useful comments from flickr commons and youtube
  container-title: International Journal on Digital Libraries
  publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg
  page: '161-179'
  volume: '16'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Cultural institutions are increasingly contributing content to social
    media platforms to raise awareness and promote use of their collections. Furthermore,
    they are often the recipients of user comments containing information that may
    be incorporated in their catalog records. However, not all user-generated comments
    can be used for the purpose of enriching metadata records. Judging the usefulness
    of a large number of user comments is a labor-intensive task. Accordingly, our
    aim was to provide automated support for curation of potentially useful social
    media comments on digital objects. In this paper, the notion of usefulness is
    examined in the context of social media comments and compared from the perspective
    of both end-users and expert users. A machine-learning approach is then introduced
    to automatically classify comments according to their usefulness. This approach
    uses syntactic and semantic comment features while taking user context into consideration.
    We present the results of an experiment we conducted on user comments collected
    from Flickr Commons collections and YouTube. A study is then carried out on the
    correlation between the commenting culture of a platform (YouTube and Flickr)
    with usefulness prediction. Our findings indicate that a few relatively straightforward
    features can be used for inferring useful comments. However, the influence of
    features on usefulness classification may vary according to the commenting cultures
    of platforms.

  title: Query expansion using open web-based SKOS vocabularies
  container-title: ACM SIGIR workshop on health search & discovery (HSD 2013)
  publisher-place: Dublin, Ireland
  abstract: Achieving high precision in search engines is particularly difficult when
    dealing with specific technical domains, such as the medical domain, where vocabulary
    mismatch problems are more prone to occur. Query expansion using lexical orsemantic
    relations is a well-known technique that can attenuate the vocabulary mismatch
    problem as demonstrated by earlier research. However, existing approaches do not
    exploit potentially connected open Web-based vocabularies that are increasingly
    being expressed using the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). In this
    paper, we propose a query expansion technique that exploits term labels and semantic
    relationships in such vocabularies to improve search results. We evaluated this
    technique using a SKOS representation of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and
    the TREC-9 Filtering datasets. Our results show that our SKOS-based query expansion
    technique improves the P10, nDCG10 and MAP metrics across various retrieval models.

  title: Web synchronization simulations using the resourcesync framework
  publisher: University of Vienna
  publisher-place: Vienna
  genre: Technical Report
  abstract: Maintenance of multiple, distributed up-to-date copies of collections
    of changing Web resources is important in many application contexts and is often
    achieved using ad hoc or proprietary synchronization solutions. ResourceSync is
    a resource synchronization framework that integrates with the Web architecture
    and leverages XML sitemaps. We define a model for the ResourceSync framework as
    a basis for understanding its properties. We then describe experiments in which
    simulations of a variety of synchronization scenarios illustrate the effects of
    model configuration on consistency, latency, and data transfer efficiency. These
    results provide insight into which congurations are appropriate for various application
    scenarios.

  title-short: RESLVE

  publisher-place: Rio de Janeiro
  abstract: We address the Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) prob- lem for short,
    user-generated texts on the social Web. In such settings, the lack of linguistic
    features and sparse lex- ical context result in a high degree of ambiguity and
    sharp performance drops of nearly 50% in the accuracy of conven- tional NED systems.
    We handle these challenges by develop- ing a model of user-interest with respect
    to a personal knowl- edge context; and Wikipedia, a particularly well-established
    and reliable knowledge base, is used to instantiate the proce- dure. We conduct
    systematic evaluations using individuals’ posts from Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr
    and demonstrate that our novel technique is able to achieve substantial per- formance
    gains beyond state-of-the-art NED methods.

    on work to implement this protocol for arXiv.org and also provide an experimental

  title: Using SKOS vocabularies for improving web search
  container-title: Web of linked entities (WoLE) workshop, co-located with WWW2013
  publisher-place: Rio de Janeiro
  abstract: Knowledge organization systems such as thesauri or taxonomies are increasingly
    being expressed using the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) and published
    as structured data on the Web. Search engines can exploit these vocabularies and
    improve search by expanding terms at query or document indexing time. We propose
    a SKOS-based term expansion and scoring technique that leverages labels and semantic
    relationships of SKOS concept definitions. We also implemented this technique
    for Apache Lucene and Solr. Experiments with the Medical Subject Headings vocabulary
    and an early evaluation with Library of Congress Subject Headings indicated gains
    in precision when using SKOS-based expansion compared to pseudo relevance feedback
    and no expansion. Our findings are important for publishers and consumer of Web
    vocabularies who want to use them for improving search over Web documents.

  title: Semantic tagging on historical maps
  container-title: ACM web science 2013
  publisher: ACM
  publisher-place: Paris, France
  abstract: Tags assigned by users to shared content can be ambiguous. As a possible
    solution, we propose semantic tagging as a collaborative process in which a user
    selects and associates Web resources drawn from a knowledge context. We applied
    this general technique in the specific context of online his- torical maps and
    allowed users to annotate and tag them. To study the effects of semantic tagging
    on tag production, the types and categories of obtained tags, and user task load,
    we conducted an in-lab within-subject experiment with 24 par- ticipants who annotated
    and tagged two distinct maps. We found that the semantic tagging implementation
    does not af- fect these parameters, while providing tagging relationships to well-defined
    concept definitions. Compared to label-based tagging, our technique also gathers
    positive and negative tag- ging relationships. We believe that our findings carry
    impli- cations for designers who want to adopt semantic tagging in other contexts
    and systems on the Web.

  publisher-place: Fort Worth, TX, USA
  abstract: Old maps are a record of the past, exposing features people might want
    to tell stories about. Maphub is a Web application that enables them to do so
    by creating annotations on digitized high-resolution historical maps. By semantically
    tagging regions on the map, users create associations between their annotations
    and resources in open Web-based data networks. These associations are leveraged
    to enable multilingual search and to generate overlays of historical maps on modern
    mapping applications. Contributed annotations are shared on the Web following
    the W3C Open Annotation specification. Preliminary studies show general user satisfaction
    with our approach.

  title: Perception and relevance of quality issues in web vocabularies
  container-title: I-semantics 2013
  publisher-place: Graz, Austria
  note: forthcoming
  abstract: Web vocabularies provide organization and orientation in information environments
    and can facilitate resource discovery and retrieval. Several tools have been developed
    that support quality assessment for the increasing amount of vocabularies expressed
    in SKOS and published as Linked Data. However, these tools do not yet take into
    account the users’ perception of vocabulary quality. In this paper, we report
    the findings from an online survey conducted among experts in the field of vocabulary
    development to study the perception and relevance of vocabulary quality issues
    in the context of real-world application scenarios. Our results indicate that
    structural and labeling issues are the most relevant ones. We also derived design
    recommendations for vocabulary quality checking tools.

  container-title: D-Lib Magazine

  issue: 9/10
  abstract: Web applications frequently leverage resources made available by remote
    web servers. As resources are created, updated, deleted, or moved, these applications
    face challenges to remain in lockstep with changes on the server. Several approaches
    exist to help meet this challenge for use cases where “good enough” synchronization
    is acceptable. But when strict resource coverage or low synchronization latency
    is required, commonly accepted Web-based solutions remain illusive. This paper
    provides a perspective on the resource synchronization problem that results from
    inspiration gained from prior work, and initial insights resulting from the recently
    launched NISO?OAI ResourceSync effort.

  abstract: Europeana is the European Union’s flagship digital cultural heritage initiative.
    the europeana portal, launched in November 2008, showcases the possibility of
    cross-cultural domain interoperability on a pan-european level. To date, metadata
    and thumbnails for over 23 million objects have been aggregated from over 1500
    providers from the library, archive, museum, and audiovisual domains. It was hoped
    that cultural heritage communities were ready to think outside the traditional
    information silos and adopt a linked data paradigm that would enable the development
    of shared semantic context. As a technical starting point, Europeana carried out
    a linked open data pilot project. This paper gives an outline of the processes
    of the pilot project and areas for future work.

  title: Finding quality issues in SKOS vocabularies
  container-title: Therory and practice of digital libraries (TPDL 2012)
  publisher-place: Germany
  abstract: The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is a standard model for
    controlled vocabularies on the Web. However, SKOS vocabularies often differ in
    terms of quality, which reduces their applicability across system boundaries.
    Here we investigate how we can support taxonomists in improving SKOS vocabularies
    by pointing out quality issues that go beyond the integrity constraints defined
    in the SKOS specification. We identified potential quality issues and formalized
    them into computable quality checking functions that can find affected resources
    in a given SKOS vocabulary. We implemented these functions in the qSKOS quality
    assessment tool, analyzed 15 existing vocabularies, and found possible quality
    issues in all of them.

  abstract: The World Wide Web has changed the way of publishing and distributing
    scholarly results. However, scholarly publications are still organized linearly
    and point to supplemental or related information only by textual references or
    at most by hyperlinks embedded into PDF documents. They are stored in closed repositories
    and we can hardly access, navigate, and use scholarly resources the way we do
    it with other Web resources. The goal of the SciLink project is to analyze scholarly
    practices in certain pilot communities, to learn how scholars currently use Web
    resources in their publications, and to design tools that help scholars in aggregating
    and publishing the building blocks of their works in a way that integrates with
    the resource-oriented Architecture of the World Wide Web. In that way, we want
    to allow humans and machine agents to access and interact with scholarly resources
    just like with any other Web resource.

  title: The open annotation collaboration (OAC) model
  container-title: Workshop on multimedia on the web 2011
  publisher: IEEE
  publisher-place: Graz, Austria
  abstract: Annotations allow users to associate additional information with existing
    resources. Using proprietary and closed systems on the Web, users are already
    able to annotate multimedia resources such as images, audio and video. So far,
    however, this information is almost always kept locked up and inaccessible to
    the Web of Data. We believe that an important step to take is the integration
    of multimedia annotations and the Linked Data principles. This should allow clients
    to easily publish and consume, thus exchange annotations about resources via common
    Web standards. We first present the current status of the Open Annotation Collaboration,
    an international initiative that is currently working on annotation interoperability
    specifications based on best practices from the Linked Data effort. Then we present
    two use cases and early prototypes that make use of the proposed annotation model
    and present lessons learned and discuss yet open technical issues.

  page: '266-283'

  abstract: The dynamics of linked datasets may lead to broken links if data providers
    do not react to changes appropriately. Such broken links denote interrupted navigational
    paths between resources and may lead to unavailability of data. As a possible
    solution, we developed DSNotify, an event-detection framework that informs actors
    about various types of changes and allows them to maintain links to resources
    in distributed linked data sets. For representing changes we developed the DSNotify
    Eventset Vocabulary. Different from other vocabularies it applies a resource-centric
    perspective and preserves the timely order of changes. We further describe our
    reusable evaluation infrastructure, which can be extended for extracting change
    sets from arbitrary linked datasets.

  abstract: Annotations are a fundamental scholarly practice common across disciplines.
    They enable scholars to organize, share and exchange knowledge, and collaborate
    in the interpretation of source material. In this paper, we introduce the YUMA
    Media Annotation Framework, an ongoing open source effort to provide integrated
    collaborative annotation functionality for digital library portals and online
    multimedia collections. YUMA supports image, map, audio and video annotation and
    follows the OAC annotation model in order to provide data interoperability. A
    unique feature of YUMA is semantic enrichment, a mechanism that allows users to
    effortlessly augment annotations with links to contextually relevant resources
    on the Linked Data Web.

  publisher-place: The Hague, The Netherlands
  abstract: data.europeana.eu is an ongoing effort of making Europeana metadata available
    as Linked Open Data on the Web. It allows others to access metadata collected
    from Europeana data providers via standard Web technologies. The data are represented
    in the Europeana Data Model (EDM) and the described resources are addressable
    and dereferencable by their URIs. Links between Europeana resources and other
    resources in the Linked Data Web will enable the discovery of semantically related
    resources. We developed an approach that allows Europeana data providers to opt
    for their data to become Linked Data and converts their metadata to EDM, benefiting
    from Europeana efforts to link them to semantically related resources on the Web.
    With that approach, we produced a first Linked Data version of Europeana and published
    the resulting datasets on the Web. We also gained experiences with respect to
    EDM, HTTP URI design, and RDF store performance and report them in this paper.

  title: A retrospective on semantics and interoperability research
  container-title: Foundations for the web of information and services
  publisher: Springer
  publisher-place: Berlin Heidelberg
  page: '3-27'
  abstract: Interoperability is a qualitative property of computing infrastructures
    that denotes the ability of sending and receiving systems to exchange and properly
    interpret information objects across system boundaries. Since this property is
    not given by default, the interoperability problem and the representation of semantics
    have been an active research topic for approximately four decades. Early database
    models such as the Relational Model used schemas to express semantics and implicitly
    aimed at achieving interoperability by providing programming independence of data
    storage and access. Thereafter the Entity Relationship Model was introduced providing
    the basic building blocks of modeling real-world semantics. With the advent of
    distributed and object-oriented databases, interoperability became an obvious
    need and an explicit research topic. After a number of intermediate steps such
    as hypertext and (multimedia) document models, the notions of semantics and interoperability
    became what they have been over the last ten years in the context of the World
    Wide Web. With this article we contribute a retrospective on semantics and interoperability
    research as applied in major areas of computer science. It gives domain experts
    and newcomers an overview of existing interoperability techniques and points out
    future research directions.

  publisher-place: Netherlands
  abstract: 'Cultural heritage institutions and private collections such as the
    Library of Congress or the David Rumsey Map Collection are increasingly providing
    free online access to high-resolution scans of old maps. With the YUMA Map Annotation
    Tool, we want to facilitate collaborative scholarly annotation for such online
    resources. A central feature of our tool is the integration of semantic linking
    into the annotation process: annotations are semi-automatically enriched with
    context information from sources on the Linked Data Web. We argue that this semantic
    contextualization is, on the one hand, relevant for scholarly collaboration. On
    the other hand, we believe that it can be exploited to improve search and retrieval
    in the collection by providing additional structured metadata and geo-referencing
    information. In this paper we present current work in which we aim to verify our
    assumptions based on maps provided by the Library of Congress, and annotations
    collected from volunteer users in an ongoing crowdsourcing experiment.'

  title: Europeana RDF store report
  publisher: University of Vienna
  publisher-place: Vienna
  genre: Technical Report
  abstract: Expressing data in RDF is one of the principles to be considered when
    making data available as Linked Data on the Web. This can be achieved using RDF-wrappers
    for existing (relational) data stores or by using RDF stores as data repositories.
    The latter requires special RDF storage solutions, many of which are available
    today. Organizations often have difficulties to decide which solution they should
    adopt because comprehensive comparisons of existing RDF stores are hardly available
    and experiences w.r.t performance and scalability are still missing. In this report,
    we summarize the results of qualitative and quantitative study we carried out
    on existing RDF stores in the context of the European Digital Library project.
    We give a detailed overview on existing RDF store solutions, analyze their functional
    and non-functional features, summarize the outcomes of other, previously carried
    out studies, and conduct a Linked-Data oriented performance evaluation on a subset
    of existing triple stores w.r.t to load and query time. The results of this study
    show that certain RDF stores, such as OpenLink Virtuoso or 4Store, can deal with
    the Europeana data volume and answer those SPARQL queries that are relevant for
    exposing Europeana metadata as Linked Data in an acceptable time-range.

  abstract: Linked Data is a way of exposing and sharing data as resources on the
    Web and interlinking them with semantically related resources. In the last three
    years significant amounts of data have been generated, increasingly forming a
    globally connected, distributed data space. For multimedia content, metadata are
    a key factor for efficient management, organization, and retrieval. However, the
    relationship between multimedia and Linked Data has been rarely studied, leading
    to a lack of mutual awareness and, as a consequence thereof, technological deficiencies.
    This article introduces the basic concepts of Linked Data in the context of multimedia
    metadata, and discusses techniques to generate, expose, discover, and consume
    Linked Data. It shows that a large amount of data sources exist, which are ready
    to be exploited by multimedia applications. The benefit of Linked Data in two
    multimedia-related applications is discussed and open research issues are outlined
    with the goal of bringing the research fields of multimedia and Linked Data closer
    together in order to facilitate mutual benefit.

  abstract: 'In this paper we present a Web-based system for annotating digitised
    old maps. Using bibliographic metadata and geographical reference information
    associated with the map, annotations are represented as spatially and temporally
    defined RDF resources. At the same time, named entity recognition and semantic
    link discovery are applied to each annotation&rsquo;s text content to further
    facilitate its interlinking within the Web of Data. To ensure quality and correctness,
    the system relies on human feedback. This feedback is introduced through a novel
    interaction metaphor: contextual link suggestions are continuously generated in
    the background, and superimposed on the annotated map region in the form of a
    tag cloud. The user can create semantic links by simply clicking on the corresponding
    tags. The system thus acts both as a visualisation aid for contextually relevant
    linked data and as a tool for authoring new linked spatiotemporal data entities.'

  title: Towards model implementation guidelines for the CIDOC conceptual reference
    model
  publisher: University of Vienna
  genre: Technical Report
  abstract: The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is regarded as an interoperability
    solution for integrating heterogeneous metadata in the cultural heritage domain.
    The major problem developers are confronted with when applying this model in real-world
    applications is that the CRM constitutes a formal ontology model on a semantic
    level but lacks technical specifications and guidelines on how to integrate that
    model with other, data source-specific models. This leads to divergent mappings
    between proprietary metadata models and the CRM ontology model. The aim of this
    paper is to provide Model Implementation Guidelines, including a CIDOC CRM mapping
    methodology, which are based on our practical experience and can serve as a recommendation
    for future CIDOC CRM adopters. Besides explicitly pointing out the problems the
    current stan- dard entails, we propose a methodology for reducing the divergence
    of CRM mappings, which should bring CRM-based systems one step further towards
    metadata interoperability.

  container-title: Int. J. Metadata, Semantics and Ontologies
  page: '17-31'
  volume: '1'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)
    has found widespread adoption for exchanging bibliographic metadata. In parallel,
    the W3C&rsquo;s Linking Open Data Initiative exposes and interlinks structured
    data from a variety of data sources on the web. Since many of these data sources
    contain valuable information for institutional repositories (e.g., shared concept
    definitions, thesauri, etc.), we believe that institutions that currently expose
    their data via OAI-PMH can benefit if they integrate their metadata with the data
    available in the Linked Data cloud. To achieve such an integration, we must bridge
    the OAI-PMH-specific protocol characteristics that currently prevent OAI-PMH metadata
    from being interoperable with the Linked Data approach of exposing data. As first
    contribution of this paper, we describe a possible solution for exposing OAI-PMH
    metadata on the web as part of the Linked Data cloud. As a second contribution,
    we present a rule-based mechanism for linking these metadata with other relevant
    data sources together with a case study that describes possible linking scenarios
    for three representative OAI-PMH data providers. Finally, we discuss certain quality
    criteria that OAI-PMH metadata must meet to benefit from data exposed by other
    Linked Data sources.

  abstract: With the increasing storage capacity of personal computing devices, the
    problems of information overload and information fragmentation are apparent on
    users? desktops. For the Web, semantic technologies solve this problem by adding
    a machine-interpretable information layer on top of existing resources. It has
    been shown that the application of these technologies to desktop environments
    is helpful for end users. However, certain characteristics of the Semantic Web
    architecture that are commonly accepted in the Web context are not desirable for
    desktops. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose the sile model, which
    combines characteristics of the Semantic Web and file systems. This model is a
    conceptual foundation for the Semantic Desktop and serves as underlying infrastructure
    on which applications and further services can be built. The authors present one
    service, a virtual file system based on siles, which allows users to semantically
    annotate files and directories and keeps full compatibility to traditional hierarchical
    file systems. The authors also discuss how Semantic Web vocabularies can be applied
    for meaningful annotation of files and present a prototypical implementation of
    the model and analyze the performance of typical access operations, both on the
    file system and metadata level.

  abstract: Cultural institutions and museums have realized that annotations contribute
    valuable metadata for search and retrieval, which in turn can increase the visibility
    of the digital items they expose via their digital library systems. By exploiting
    annotations created by others, visitors can discover content they would not have
    found otherwise, which implies that annotations must be accessible and processable
    for humans and machines. Currently, however, there exists no widely adopted annotation
    standard that goes beyond specific media types. Most institutions build their
    own in-house annotation solution and employ proprietary annotation models, which
    are not interoperable with those of other systems. As a result, annotation data
    are usually stored in closed data silos and visible and processable only within
    the scope of a certain annotation system. As the main contribution of this paper,
    we present the LEMO Annotation Framework. It (1) provides a uniform annotation
    model for multimedia contents and various types of annotations, (2) can address
    fragments of various content-types in a uniform, interoperable manner and (3)
    pulls annotations out of closed data silos and makes them available as interoperable,
    dereferencable Web resources. With the LEMO Annotation Framework annotations become
    part of the Web and can be processed, linked, and referenced by other services.
    This in turn leads to even higher visibility and increases the potential value
    of annotations.

  title-short: The OAI2LOD server
  container-title: International workshop on linked data on the web (LDOW2008), co-located
    with WWW 2008
  publisher-place: Beijing, China
  abstract: 'Many institutions grant access to their metadata repositories via the
    Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). However,
    this protocol has two significant drawbacks: it does not make its resources accessible
    via dereferencable URIs, and it provides only restricted means of selective access
    to metadata. The OAI2LOD Server handles these shortcomings by republishing metadata
    originating from an OAI-PMH endpoint according to the principles of Linked Data.
    As the ongoing OAI-ORE specification process shows, these principles are gaining
    growing importance also in the digital libraries domain.'

  publisher-place: Budapest, Hungary
  abstract: In this presentation, we focus on a solution for providing uniform access
    to Digital Libraries and other online services. In order to enable uniform query
    access to heterogeneous sources, we must provide metadata interoperability in
    a way that a query language &ndash; in this case SPARQL &ndash; can cope with
    the incompatibility of the metadata in various sources without changing their
    already existing information models.

  title: A service oriented architecture for integrating metadata from heterogeneous
    digital libraries
  container-title: The 1st international workshop on semantic information integration
    on knowledge discovery (SIIK 2006)
  publisher-place: Yogyakarta, Indonesia
  abstract: Metadata in today’s digital library systems are accessible through various
    incompatible interfaces and correspond to heterogeneous schemas. Clients that
    want to search over a number of distributed metadata sources require a solution
    that provides uniform and location transparent access to these systems without
    replicating the metadata stored therein. In this paper we describe a metadata
    integration approach that conceives these data sources as services in the sense
    of a service oriented architecture. Without forcing clients to adopt a pre-defined
    mediation schema, we want to give them the possibility to query multiple autonomous
    and distributed metadata services by formulating SPARQL queries.

  title: Joining the bricks network - a piece of cake
  container-title: The international EVA conference
  publisher-place: Moscow, Russia
  abstract: Project BRICKS aims to build a Europe-wide distributed Digital Library
    in the field of Cultural Heritage. Each member organisation will run a node in
    the network (BRICKS node or BNode) and make its content available to the entire
    network. Content described in diverse Metadata standards can be searched with
    a unique query. Unlike other Digital Libraries, BRICKS is open and expandable,
    both on the organizational and the technical level. The aim of this paper is to
    demonstrate that the technical effort of joining the BRICKS network is minimal
    compared with the potential benefits of joining the BRICKS community. This paper
    focuses on the BRICKS importer component, which is based on the Open Archives
    Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). After a short overview of the architecture
    of the importer and an outline of OAI-PMH, we list the technical requirements
    of the importer give a detailed list of the steps an institution take to join
    BRICKS. We also present first results obtained with our importer component.

  title: Metadata management in a heterogeneous digital library
  container-title: EChallenges 2005
  publisher: IOS Press
  publisher-place: Ljubljana, Slovenia
  abstract: Many institutions operating in the cultural heritage domain have already
    made their content accessible via the Internet. However, when organizations want
    to realize projects that integrate content from various institutions, they face
    the problem of how to make this content accessible in a coherent way. Since metadata
    plays a key role in such scenarios, a Metadata Management system that can handle
    heterogeneous metadata descriptions and be easily integrated into new or existing
    digital library architectures would be useful. We propose a Metadata Management
    system that uses Semantic Web technology to handle the problem of heterogeneity
    and on Web Service technology to achieve easy system integration. Our solution
    facilitates the development of integrated digital library systems, and lifburden
    of heterogeneous metadata management from application developers.
